Congress API -- Look up legislators!
====================================

The Sunlight Labs Congress API provides methods for obtaining basic information
on Members of Congress, legislator IDs used by various websites, and lookups
between places and the politicians that represent them. The primary purpose of
the API is to facilitate mashups involving politicians and the various other
APIs that are out there.
